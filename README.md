2-Player Webcam Bat Game
A fun, interactive 2-player game built with Pygame, OpenCV, and NumPy, where each player controls a paddle using colored objects (Green for Player 1 and Blue for Player 2) detected through their webcam.

🚀 Features
✅ Two-player mode — each player controls a paddle at opposite ends of the screen.
✅ Paddle control using real-time webcam color detection.
✅ Collision detection and ball bouncing mechanics.
✅ Runs at a smooth 60 FPS using Pygame.

📷 Controls
🎯 Player 1: Hold a green-colored object in front of the webcam to control the bottom paddle.
🎯 Player 2: Hold a blue-colored object in front of the webcam to control the top paddle.

The paddles move horizontally as you move your colored object.
